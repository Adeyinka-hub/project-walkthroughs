# Project Overview

In this project, we'll predict the winner of football matches in the English Premier League (EPL).  In this project, we will:

* Scrape match data using requests, BeautifulSoup, and pandas.  
* Clean the data and get it ready for machine learning using pandas.
* Make predictions using scikit-learn.
* Measure error and improve our predictions.

# Project Overview

In this project, we'll build a k-means clustering algorithm from scratch.  Clustering is an unsupervised machine learning technique that can find patterns in your data.  K-means is one of the most popular forms of clustering.

We'll create our algorithm using Python and pandas.  We'll then compare it to the reference implementation from scikit-learn.

**Project Steps**

* Write out pseudocode for the algorithm
* Code the k-means algorithm
* Plot the clusters from the algorithm
* Compare performance to the scikit-learn algorithm
